A program which draws a teapot with two light sources (Based on Professor Shafae's hello_glsl program).
This program adds additional controls which evokes the following functions:
    O button: moveCameraForward( );
	L button: moveCameraBackward( );
	K button: panCameraLeft( );
	; button: panCameraRight( );
The reset button has also been updated to evoke the following additional functions: 
	initCenterPosition( );
	initGazeDirection( );

Defects:
1. Whenever a user gets behind the teapot, the forward and backward functions are not inverted
2. Whenever a user uses the functions to manipulate the teapot itself, the subsequent camera movement functions behave unexpectedly
